1. translate from one character to another ✅
2. translate range of characters (range input range output)
    2.1  convert range to lists
        2.1.1 ranges with hyphen [a-z] [A-Z] [0-9] ✅
        2.1.2 ranges without any space [abc], [aeiou] ✅
    2.2 use list of chars from ranges to replace characters ✅
3. translate class of characters (class input class output)
    3.1 convert class to list of characters ✅
	    classes: alnum alpha   digit lowe space upper
    3.2 use list of chars from ranges to replace characters (i think 2.2 will eliminate this)✅

4. Delete input characters
    4.1 based on range✅
    4.2 based on class✅

5. Squash characters
6. Scale the solution 
    7.1 probably stream or yield, lets find out when reach there
